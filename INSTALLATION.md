# Installation guide

1. install paho mqtt client in your terminal.

 ```
    pip3 install paho-mqtt
 ```

 That will download the Paho MQTT library from the web repository and install it in your computer. If pip3 is not found, try with `pip` instead of `pip3`.

 To install manually, you can download the source code from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.1, extract it and in the terminal navigate to folder where paho-mqtt is extracted. Then type

 ```
    python3 setup.py install
 ```
 again if `python3` is not found, try `python` instead
