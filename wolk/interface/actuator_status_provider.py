    Get current actuator status identified by reference.

    Reads the status of actuator from the device
    and returns it as a tuple containing the actuator state and current value.

    If unable to get current actuator value,
    return `(State.ERROR, None)`.

    Optionally, the function can also return a timestamp as part of the tuple
    easily obtained with `int(round(time.time() * 1000))`.

    Must be implemented as non blocking.
    Must be implemented as thread safe.
